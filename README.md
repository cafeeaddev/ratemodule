# Rate block for Moodle 

The Rating with Stars block was created so that the student can rate activities in Moodle from one to five stars.

In this version, he will not be able to change his opinion and the data is being recorded in the mdl_block_ratemodule database table, where we record the following data:

rating - number of stars chosen
coursemoduleid - id of the course module in which the block was inserted
userid - id of the user who is evaluating
timecreated - evaluation date

Attention: In this version of the block we do not have an administrative area of reports, it will be available in the next version.
